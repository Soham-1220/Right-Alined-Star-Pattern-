# Right-Alined-Star-Pattern-


This C++ program prints a right-aligned triangular star pattern using nested loops. The pattern consists of stars (*) aligned to the right, starting with one star on the top row and increasing by one on each subsequent row. The program uses a combination of spaces and stars to create the right alignment. The outer loop controls the number of rows, while the inner loops handle spacing and star placement. This is a beginner-friendly example of how nested loops and formatting can be used to manipulate output alignment in C++. The height of the triangle can be easily adjusted by changing the n value.
